Module 3 Challenge

Lets calculate your Savings and CD interest. This software will take your
input for how much you have in your balance, then interest APR and how many
months you will be investing. After the algorithm will calculate your 
interest earned with a new balance. The prompt will ask for your savings 
account first, calculate; then your CD account information will follow. 

This program is demostrating how to use functions from other .py files. 
Also how to pass in parameters from the user input and calculate those
inputs and return updated values. This is a great program for that 
foundational knowledge.
